# Basic-Jekyll
A port of ['Basic'](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/basic), a theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

This was replicated from a single screenshot and the GitHub code. Inaccuracies to the original are meant to be expected, but I'm not willing to put enough effort into this to justify actually setting up and running an instance of Pelican.

Tags, categories, and the author page are intentionally left out. The page numbers were eyeballed as well.

If you run into issues, then do some Googling. I don't plan on supporting this.
