# Basic-Jekyll
A port of ['Basic'](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/basic), a theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/), to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

This was replicated from a [single screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/master/basic/screenshot.png) and the code in [the theme's repo](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/basic). 

Inaccuracies from the original are to be expected, because I'm not willing to put enough effort into this to justify actually setting up and running an instance of Pelican so I can reverse engineer every last detail.

Tags, categories, and the author page are intentionally left out. The page numbers were eyeballed as well, and of course the original post syntax of Pelican does not work here.

Also, keep in mind that multiple pages' HTML structures aren't like the original Pelican theme. It looks and works like the Pelican theme (mostly), but many things meant to work with Pelican themes won't work with this.

If you're going to really use this, I've left some neat embed includes in for you to mess around with.

If you run into issues, then do some Googling on your own. I don't plan on supporting this, and I'm not willing to help you troubleshoot. 

I mainly made this as a test of skill, so I can prove to myself my abilities. Also, it's something nice to put down on a résumé, if I need to fill space. 

If you wish to go further than I did in porting the theme over, then please contribute to this repository.
