# Basic-Jekyll
A port of ['Basic'](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/basic), a theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

This was replicated from a single screenshot and the code in the themes repo. Inaccuracies from the original are to be expected, because I'm not willing to put enough effort into this to justify actually setting up and running an instance of Pelican so I can reverse engineer every last detail.

Tags, categories, and the author page are intentionally left out. The page numbers were eyeballed as well, and of course the original post syntax of Pelican does not work here.

If you're going to really use this, I've left some neat embed includes in that I made.

If you run into issues, then do some Googling on your own. I don't plan on supporting this, and I'm not willing to help you troubleshoot.
